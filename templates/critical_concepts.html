    <p>
        This page helps you develop your decision's Critical Concepts, which are the one, two or three things that
        really matter to you. They answer: 'What am I really solving for?' There's no one right answer.
        <a href="/ccex" target="_blank">Two people
            looking at the same data may well have different Critical Concepts and may make entirely different decisions</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of your decision like a poker hand. How do you increase your odds of winning â€“ of choosing your best path
        forward? You've got incomplete information, and the future will change in some ways you can predict and many you
        can't. But as the pros at a poker table will tell you (unless they're playing against you), you don't have to
        know <i>everything</i> because you only have to focus on what hands your cards can beat.
    </p>
    <p>
        What are the outcomes that matter for you in this game? Every poker player has a set of skills but they start
        each hand fresh, figuring out what's critical for that hand. The same will be true for you as a decision maker
        developing your decision's Critical Concepts. As they say in poker, that's where you're "pot-committed."
        You've got chips on the table and a vested interest. The game is highly personal, subjective and specific to
        your situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        List your Critical Concepts in order of importance.
