    Being the Detective means that you are committed to learning, which
    means that you tend to have more information and be better informed
    than the people around you. You are focused when you are faced with
    a decision. You don't let your emotions distract you, and that means
    you can thoughtfully look at the evidence around you. You are down to
    earth, and you don't settle for nonsense. You don't have a problem
    making a decision once you feel like you have the right information.

    Being a Detective comes with a few drawbacks, too. Sometimes, because
    you are gathering so much evidence, the information can blend together
    and you can lose your ability to be objective. More information does
    not always make for a better decision. If you use new information to
    confirm what you already thought you may fall prey to "confirmation bias."
    Although you are driven by the facts, sometimes when you make decisions
    about the future, you assume that your preferences are going to stay
    the same forever. This "projection bias" makes you interpret the facts
    based on an outdated idea of success. Finally, because you like
    to soak up lots of information, you sometimes don't do a good job with
    time management; this "planning fallacy" means that you get so focused
    on learning that you don't make your decision on time.

{% block your_psp_explanation %}
    You value information and are always looking for the facts. You don't make your decisions based on how
    you feel—you
    see what the evidence says, and you listen to it. You believe that the more you learn, the better you'll
    do—and
    you're committed to gathering as much information as you can.

{% block your_psp_why %}
    Why is Marie Curie a Detective? Marie Curie was the only woman to ever win two Nobel Prizes.
    She did it by systematically gathering data and testing it out to make the discovery of not one, but
    two, new elements: polonium and radium. That's why she is a detective like you.
