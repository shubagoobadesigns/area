    Being the Thinker means that you will never get caught off guard by
    the consequences of the decisions you make. You are extremely thorough
    and thoughtful. You are cautious—you know what warning signs to look
    for, and you are good at steering yourself away from them. You're a
    master at making pro and con lists, and you rarely make impulse
    decisions. This is a powerful thing, because you always know what
    you're up against. It's hard to trick you, because you never act
    without considering every possible angle.

{% block blind_spot_text %}
    Being a Thinker can have its negatives, too. Sometimes, because you
    are so cautious, you pick the safe option so that you don't end up
    failing. This "loss aversion" means that you lose out on the
    opportunity to fail, and learn from your failures, which is proven
    to help you grow twice as fast as success does. Because you are a
    master at comparing and weighing your options, you sometimes don’t
    weigh the value of each option individually. For example, option 1 may
    cost less than option 2, but if they are both under your budget,
    there's no need to eliminate the more expensive option. This
    "relativity bias" keeps you from seeing things as they actually are,
    and forces you to see them in comparison to something else. And
    finally, because you are committed to thoughtfully looking at what the
    "best" option is, you have the tendency to believe what authority
    figures say and could fall prey to “authority bias.” If someone you
    admire suggests a decision path, you'll give that choice more weight
    than you should.

{% block your_psp_explanation %}
    You are a thoughtful decision maker, and you take your time weighing the options before making a
    decision. You look at all the possibilities, and because you are able to see the good and the bad in
    everything, you like to think on it before taking action. You're committed to always making the best
    possible decision, and you're in no rush to make it.

{% block your_psp_why %}Why is Albert Einstein a Thinker?
    Most people think that genius is the primary determinant of intellectual achievement. Yet one of the
    greatest
    thinkers of all time, Albert Einstein was not an inexplicable genius, but a questioning mind. His
    intellectual
    skills and inquisitive drive enabled him to develop great questions that he then used to search for
    answers that
    redesigned our view of the physical world and the universe.
