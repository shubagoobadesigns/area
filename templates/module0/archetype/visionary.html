    As a Visionary, your great strength is being able to see possibilities
    that other people may miss. When things seem too obvious, you get
    bored; you prefer to imagine and dream up new ways of doing things
    that no one has ever thought of. You are an innovator and an inventor.
    These traits make you a powerful decision-maker because to you, the
    best option is the one you create yourself. The people around you
    admire what a strong individual you are. You aren't afraid to do what
    might be unpopular if you believe it will give you the best results.
    This also makes you a natural leader.

{% block blind_spot_text %}
    Being the Visionary does have its drawbacks. You have a tendency to
    believe that with a creative spirit, you can accomplish anything. This
    can lead to "optimism bias" where you are over confident in your judgment.

    Optimism can also lead to "planning fallacy" where you think making
    a decision will take you less time to make than it actually does. This
    means that you can fall behind.

    Because you tend to lean on your imagination, rather than do research,
    your opinions are sometimes shaped by limited information. Because you
    are drawn to exciting ideas, you often get attached to the most recent
    or bold information or ideas, even if they aren't ultimately the most
    important.

    This "saliency bias" leads you to make you make judgements based on a
    superficial understanding of the decision you're trying to make. Finally,
    because you like to go our own way, you sometimes try too hard to be an
    original. This tendency to overvalue originality because it's rare,
    called the "scarcity bias," leads you invest in being different as
    opposed to making the smartest decision.

{% block your_psp_explanation %}
    In any situation, you believe that there's always another, better way. When you see two options, you
    immediately think of what a more powerful third option could be. You don't like to settle for the
    ordinary, and you like to go your own way. You keep everyone guessing—and usually, you surprise those
    around you with your decisions!

    What makes Beyoncé a Visionary?
    Beyoncé is a legendary musician who continually stretches and changes what she's doing musically. She
    began as part
    of the group Destiny’s Child and then went solo. Most recently, she's taken to political commentary in
    her music,
    using her album Lemonade to make a statement that connected one woman's troubles to the broader
    struggles faced
    by women of color.
