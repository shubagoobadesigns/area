    <p>See why we need our bias? Researchers tell us we make 40,000 decisions every day!</p>
    <p>If we didn't have bias we'd run out time like you may have in the Bias Game because you had to stop to think about your answers.</p>

          title="Assumptions and judgements that cut corners and save time in our decision-making but may block us from receiving new information or insight">Biases</a>
        are judgements or assumptions about a person, place or thing that are often based on past experience.</p>
    <p>Our bias helps us rely on what we think we know, or on the judgement of others who we like or trust.</p>
