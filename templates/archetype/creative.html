    The Visionary!
</h3>
<p class="quote">"Everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you." -Steve
    Jobs</p>
<p>
    In any situation, you believe that there's always another, better way. When you see two options, you immediately
    think of what a more powerful third option could be. You don't like to settle for the ordinary, and you like to go
    your own way. You keep everyone guessing—and usually, you surprise those around you with your decisions!
</p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<p>
    As a Visionary, your great strength is being able to see possibilities that other people may miss. When things seem
    too obvious, you get bored; you prefer to imagine and dream up new ways of doing things that no one has ever thought
    of. You are an innovator and an inventor. These traits make you a powerful decision-maker because to you, the best
    option is the one you create yourself. The people around you admire what a strong individual you are. You aren't
    afraid to do what might be unpopular if you believe it will give you the best results. This also makes you a natural
    leader.
</p>
<h4>Blind Spots</h4>
<p>
    Being the Visionary does have its drawbacks. You have a tendency to believe that with a creativity spirit, you can
    accomplish anything. This can lead to “optimism bias” where you are over confident in your judgment. Optimism can
    also lead to "planning fallacy" where you think carrying out a decision will take you less time to make than it
    actually does. This means that you fall behind a lot. Because you tend to lean on your imagination, rather than do
    research, your opinions are sometimes shaped by limited information. Because you are drawn to exciting ideas, you
    often get attached to the most recent or bold information or ideas, even if they aren't ultimately the most
    important. This "saliency bias" leads you to make you make judgements based on a superficial understanding of the
    decision you're trying to make. Finally, because you like to go our own way, you sometimes try too hard to be an
    original. This tendency to overvalue originality because it’s rare, called the "scarcity bias," leads you invest in
    being different as opposed to making the smartest decision.
