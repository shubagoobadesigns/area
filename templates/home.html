            What does your {% include "problem_solver.html" %} Profile say about you? Cheryl explains:
        </p>
        <p class="margin-top-30-mob center margin-0-auto">
            The {% include "problem_solver.html" %} Profiles reflect a few realities about how we make decisions and the
            mental shortcuts that help us make small decisions well but hinder
            our insight, understanding and creativity when solving high stakes problems.
            For while we are all flawed thinkers, swayed by everything from experience to authority, we need a way to
            pry open
            cognitive space to allow for new information and analysis when solving complex problems.
            We want to make sure that our own preconceptions
            and mental shortcuts aren't directing our attention away from unfamiliar, yet viable opportunities.
