    <p>
        Take a question like "Should I go away to college?" This has no right answer but it probably has a right answer
        for YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of answering that question which may be difficult AREA inverts decision making to focus on your vision
        of success.
    </p>
    <p>Answer this: How would you know that you've made a good decision for you? List three things.</p>
    <p id="nylah_button">
        <button><a href="#" onclick="$('#nylah_button').hide(); $('#nylah').show(); return false;">What might Nylah
            say?</a></button>
    </p>

    <div id="nylah" style="display:none;">
        <p>Nylah might answer:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My family is happy with my decision.</li>
            <li>I'm able to afford it.</li>
            <li>It has a good graphic design program.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="center">
            <button id="next"><a href="deriving_cc">But...</a></button>
            <a href="directions" id="back">Back</a>
        </p>
