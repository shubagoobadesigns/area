        Your results will be grouped based on how
        <span class="button-instructions">Easy</span> or
        <span class="button-instructions">Hard</span> you found each decision to make and whether you were
        <span class="button-instructions">Confident</span> or
        <span class="button-instructions">Unsure</span> about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some decisions that seem easy can be hard to make while other hard ones are right in our comfort zone.
