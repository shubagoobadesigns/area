    <h3>Decision Dilemmas - Results!</h3>

    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>Because - there is a relationship between <b>ease and difficulty</b> in making a decision and the
        <b>confidence</b> that you have in your ability to make a successful one. There is also a relationship between
        knowing <b>how</b> to tackle a problem and whether or not you have a <b>process</b> or system.
