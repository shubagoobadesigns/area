    <h3>Decision Dilemmas - Results!</h3>
    <p>How'd you do and how did it feel?</p>
    <p>Here are your results! We have graphed your decisions based on how easy or difficult you found each question to
        answer, and whether you knew how to make the decision. </p>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>Because - there is a relationship between <b>ease and difficulty</b> in making a decision and the
        <b>confidence</b> that you have in your ability to make a successful one. There is also a relationship between
        knowing <b>how</b> to tackle a problem and whether or not you have a <b>process</b> or system.
