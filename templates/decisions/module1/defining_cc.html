    <p>
        To make big decisions better starting at the end can help you make sure that you are solving for what really
        matters to you in the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        By thinking about what you need for the decision to succeed before you solve it you know where you need to end
        up-and you can now tell the story of your success.
    </p>
    <p>
        AREA calls these your CRITICAL CONCEPTS.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Critical Concepts are the one, two or three things that really define your decision's success.

        Your Critical Concepts may be similar-or they may be different. They will reflect what matters to you
        personally.
