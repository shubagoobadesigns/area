    <p>
        Now let's have you think about making a big decision better!
        Is there an issue that is bothering you that is unresolved?
    </p>
    <p>
        Hint: Think of a decision that would benefit from a process and needs some time and attention like the questions you've seen.
    </p>
    <h4>
What is it?
    </h4>
    <h4>
Can you pose it as a question or a problem that needs to be resolved?
    </h4>
    <h4>
    <input type="text" name="decision" class="cc" size="30" />
    </h4>
    <p>
        <input type="submit" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" name="submit" value="Submit Decision"/>
    </p>

        function validate() {
            var valid = true;
            $('.cc').each(function () {
                if ($(this).val().length < 10) {
                    if (valid) {
                        alert("Please provide a decision.");
                    }
