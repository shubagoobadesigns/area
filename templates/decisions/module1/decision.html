    <h3>
        Now let's have you think about making a big decision better!
        Is there an issue that is bothering you that is unresolved?
    </h3>
    <div>
        Hint: Think of a decision that would benefit from a process and needs some time and attention like the questions
        you've seen.
    </div>

    <h3 class="center">
        <input type="text" name="decision" class="cc decision" size="40" placeholder="Type Your Decision Here" value="{{ decision }}"/>
    </h3>

    <h3>
    Now read your decision above and check the following:
    </h3>
    <h3>
        <span class="light-blue" style="font-size: larger;">&#10004;</span>
        Do I need facts or evidence?
        <br/>
        <span class="light-blue" style="font-size: larger;">&#10004;</span>
        Would it be useful to learn from other people?
        <br/>
        <span class="light-blue" style="font-size: larger;">&#10004;</span>
        Do I need to develop better self awareness about how I understand my decision?
        <br/>
        <span class="light-blue" style="font-size: larger;">&#10004;</span>
        Have I posed it as a question?
    </h3>
