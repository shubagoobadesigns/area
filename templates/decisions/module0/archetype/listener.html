    You've got a whole village of people in your life who you trust and who support you. When you are faced with a
    challenge or a decision, you know you can rely on your people. They love you, and you love them - and it means you
    always have great advice ready for you when you ask.

    Why is Mahatma Gandhi a listener?
    Mahatma Gandhi was able to change India through non-violence because of his ability to listen to others and
    understand the needs of his people and their arguments. In turn his listening enabled him to be persuasive, able to
    reason and negotiate between conflicting parties, whether it was Muslims and Hindus, or between the British
    government and its Indian subjects.
