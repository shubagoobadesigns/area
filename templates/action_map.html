                You are an Adventurer and you trust your gut. But that optimism may mean that you don't fully explore
                how
                your actions play out, especially when it comes to downside scenarios. For Adventurers like you the
                Scenario Analysis is a great tool to overcome bias. It asks you to fully imagine and play out different
                results for your decision.

                how your actions will play out, especially when it comes to weighing both the pros and cons. For
                Detectives like you the Pro/Con Analysis is a great tool to overcome bias. It asks you to lay out the

        <div id="cheetahPopup" title="Cheetah Sheets Explained">
            <p>
                Why the cheetah? Because the cheetah's prodigious hunting skills are not due to its speed. Rather, it's
                the animals' ability to <i>decelerate</i> quickly that makes them fearsome hunters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheetahs habitually run down their prey at speeds approaching 60 miles per hour but are able to cut
                their
                speed by nine miles per hour <i>in a single stride</i>, an advantage in hunting greater than being able
                to
                accelerate like a race car. This allows the cheetah to make sharp turns, sideways jumps and direction
                changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                As cheetah researcher Alan Wilson, explained in a New York Times article a few years ago, "The hunt is
                muchm ore about maneuvering, about acceleration, about ducking and diving to capture the prey."
                Like the cheetah's hunt, the AREA Method offers both stability and maneuverability; it doesn't
                consistently
                move forward. Instead, it benefits from calculated pauses and periods of thoughtful deceleration that
                will
                enable you to consolidate knowledge before accelerating again. The reason: a quality research and
                decision
                making process is about depth, flexibility and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The method's cheetah pauses work as 'strategic stops' during and after each part of your research. They
                enable you to chunk your learning, prevent you from going off course, and provide a clear record of your
                work at each stage. But most importantly, they will help you hone in on your motivation for making your
                high stakes decision and identify what is most critical to you in the outcome.
