    <p>Robyn's Research:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Articles about an increasingly younger population living in Milwaukee</li>
        <li>Articles about redeveloped and revitalized downtown with more housing</li>
        <li>Articles reporting about how local news perceives Robynâ€™s company</li>
        <li>Articles related to Milwaukee travel:  local economy contracting, number and frequency of flights are being cut from Milwaukee airport</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Robyn's answers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3. A lot more questions:she likes the news about a younger population and revitalized  downtown but worries about news of slowing economy and the prospect of a lot of travel from a place without substantial direct flights.</li>
        <li>5. Robyn found some good sources: Local employees, the Milwaukee TimeOut contact for social life a local travel agent to better understand travel issues.</li>
    </ul>
