1. Identify the possible hypotheses that merit detailed examination. 
2. Make a list of significant evidence and arguments for and against each hypothesis. 
3. Prepare a chart with hypotheses across the top and evidence down the side. Analyze the evidence against each hypothesis. Identify which pieces of evidence confirm each hypothesis, which are disconfirming and which may need more research to be able to tell whether they confirm or disconfirm the hypotheses.	 
4. Refine the chart. Reconsider the hypotheses and delete evidence and arguments that have no diagnostic value.
5. Draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Proceed by trying to disprove the hypotheses rather than prove them. 
6. Analyze how sensitive your conclusion is to a few critical items of evidence. Consider the consequences for your analysis if that evidence were wrong, misleading, or subject to a different interpretation.
7. Report conclusions. Discuss the relative likelihood of all the hypotheses, not just the most likely one.
8. Identify milestones for future observation that may indicate events are taking a different course than expected.
