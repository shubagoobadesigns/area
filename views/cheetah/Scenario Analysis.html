    <li> Upside: The first story might have everything proceeding normally with things falling into place and a happy
        ending, but should remain pragmatic and feasible. Tell the story in detail, laying it out step-by-step to reach
        the best possible outcome from your decision. Keep asking yourself And what happened next? Resist the temptation
        to skip to the end of the “story” without imagining the challenges or journey on the way. By describing the
        steps to a successful outcome for your research target you may generate even more scenarios for what might occur
        and when. If you can’t figure out how they get from A to B, maybe B isn’t as realistic as you thought.
    </li>
    <li> Downside: Tell a different story about the same challenge. This time imagine the outcome of the decision going
        wrong, unexpected challenges impeding the progress, thwarting and derailing success. This scenario imagines the
        process being a struggle with a bad ending. Through this story, you may come to understand where the real
        challenges lie and how the decision might unravel.
    </li>
    <li> Base: The final version is in the middle, neither great nor terrible. Perhaps it is a mediocre outcome, nothing
        disastrous yet no triumph. How does that scenario unfold? Again, fill in as much detail as possible.
