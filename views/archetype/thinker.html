<h3>You are... The Thinker!</h3>
<p>
    You are a thoughtful decision maker, and you take your time weighing the options before making a decision. You look
    at all the possibilities, and because you are able to see the good and the bad in everything, you like to think on
    it before taking action. You're committed to always making the best possible decision, and you're in no rush to make
    it.
</p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<p>
    Being The Thinker means that you will never get caught off guard by the consequences of the decisions you make. You
    are extremely thorough and thoughtful. You are cautious—you know what warning signs to look for, and you are good at
    steering yourself away from them. You're a master at making pro and con lists, and you rarely make impulse
    decisions. This is a powerful thing, because you always know what you're up against. It's hard to trick you, because
    you never act without considering every possible angle.
</p>
<h4>Blind Spots</h4>
<p>
    Being a Thinker can have its negatives, too. Sometimes, because you are so cautious, you lose pick the safe option
    so that you don't end up failing. This "loss aversion" means that you lose out on the opportunity to fail, and learn
    from your failures, which is proven to help you grow twice as fast as success does. Because you are a master at
    comparing and weighing your options, you actually sometimes fail to see the value of each option individually. For
    example, option 1 may cost less than option 2, but if they are both under your budget, there's no need to eliminate
    the most expensive option. This "relativity bias" keeps you from seeing things as they actually are, and forces you
    to see them in comparison to something else. That's dangerous! And finally, because you are committed to
    thoughtfully looking at what the "best" option is, you have the tendency to believe what authority figures say is
    the best. If someone you look up to suggests you make a decision, you'll give that choice more weight than you
    should. Watch out for these biases that you have—if you know what they are, you can make sure to protect yourself
    from them!
